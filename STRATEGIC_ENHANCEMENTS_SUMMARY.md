  - Error tracking (which module failed, why)
  - User choices (modules enabled, presets used)
  - Prompt editing behavior (edits made, frequency)
  - Output quality metrics
- **Privacy:** Opt-in, anonymized, Apple guidelines compliant

#### Stage 5: Credits Telemetry (Task 5.4)
- **File:** `CreditsTelemetryService.swift`
- **Tracks:**
  - Credit redemption (when, how many, for what module)
  - Purchase behavior (packages, frequency, timing)
  - Usage patterns (credits per module, burn rate)
  - Conversion metrics (free to paid)
  - Error tracking (failed purchases, refunds)
  - Free entitlement tracking

#### Stage 6: Video Generation Telemetry (Task 6.8)
- **File:** `VideoTelemetryService.swift`
- **Tracks:**
  - Video generation metrics (clips, duration, style, resolution)
  - Performance tracking (generation time, success rate, errors)
  - User preferences (most used styles, durations, formats)

    - Generation cost multipliers (resolution, style)
  - **Free tier management:**
    - Free clip entitlement
    - Free credits on signup
  - **Feature gating:**
    - Free features vs. Pro features
    - UI display per tier

  - Video duration
  - Actual token/API usage
  - Processing time & retries
- **Calculates:** Unit cost per clip
- **Stores:** For developer review in dashboard
- **Integration:** Feeds into `MonetizationConfig` for dynamic pricing

#### Pricing Logic
```swift
public struct CostBaseline: Codable {
    let promptLength: Int
    let videoDuration: TimeInterval
    let apiTokensUsed: Int
    let apiCost: Decimal
    let processingTime: TimeInterval
    let retries: Int
    let unitCostPerClip: Decimal  // Calculated baseline
    let timestamp: Date
}
```

- **Onboarding:** Built after main features are usable (mid-to-late)
- **Localization:** Scaffolded after UI is locked
- **Accessibility:** Validated after core UX-UI is finalized
- **Security Audit:** Scheduled at the very end

### No Disruption
