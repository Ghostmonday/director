# 🔍 Xcode Testing Workflow Update

## 🔄 Previous Workflow
```
1. Cheetah completes module
2. Xcode testing IMMEDIATELY
3. Move to next task
```

## ✅ New Workflow
```
1. Cheetah completes module
2. Cheetah runs validation checks
3. Cheetah triggers AUTO-PR
4. BugBot reviews PR
5. 🔍 YOU TEST IN XCODE
6. You approve
7. Move to next module
```

---

## 🎯 Why This Change?

### Benefits of New Workflow:
1. **Complete Automation First**
   - BugBot catches technical issues
   - Ensures code quality before manual testing

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Automated checks (build, lint, security)
   - Manual Xcode testing
   - Multiple layers of validation

3. **Clear Approval Process**
   - Wait for BugBot
   - Then wait for your Xcode testing
   - Explicit "ready for next module" step

---

## 📋 Xcode Testing Checklist

After BugBot approves, you'll:
- [ ] Build project in Xcode
- [ ] Run all compilation checks
- [ ] Test functionality programmatically
- [ ] Verify feature works as specified
- [ ] Confirm readiness for next module

---

## 🚀 Impact on Reconstruction

- **43 modules** will follow this new workflow
- Each module gets:
  1. Cheetah implementation
  2. BugBot review
  3. Your Xcode testing
  4. Explicit approval

---

## 💡 Example Flow

### Task 1.4: Update RewordingModule

```
1. Cheetah updates rewording.swift
2. Cheetah validates locally
3. Cheetah runs: 
   ./automation/scripts/create-module-pr.sh RewordingModule
4. BugBot reviews PR
   - Checks build
   - Runs linters
   - Scans for issues
5. 🔍 YOU TEST IN XCODE
   - Build project
   - Run tests
   - Verify functionality
6. You approve
7. Move to Task 1.4b (Rewording UI)
```

---

## 🎯 Your Role

### Before Approval, Verify:
- Code compiles
- No unexpected errors
- Module works as expected
- Ready for next stage

### If Issues Found:
- Provide specific feedback
- Cheetah will fix and re-submit
- Repeat process
