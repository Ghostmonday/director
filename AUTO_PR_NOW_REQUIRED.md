# ✅ AUTO-PR Now REQUIRED for All Modules

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Change:** Automation triggers changed from optional to required

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Optional):
```markdown
🤖 AUTO-PR TRIGGER (Optional):
If module is complete and ready for review, run:
./automation/scripts/create-module-pr.sh <ModuleName>
```

### After (REQUIRED):
```markdown
🤖 AUTO-PR TRIGGER:
✅ REQUIRED - Run immediately after validation:
./automation/scripts/create-module-pr.sh <ModuleName>

⏸️ WAIT for BugBot approval before proceeding to next task
```

---

## 📊 Impact

### For Cheetah:
- ✅ Must run automation script after each module completion
- ✅ Must wait for BugBot approval before continuing
- ✅ Clear module names provided for each task
- ✅ No ambiguity - automation is part of the workflow

### For You:
- ✅ Every module gets automatic PR + BugBot review
- ✅ Issues caught immediately, not at the end
- ✅ Complete audit trail in `automation/logs/pr-tracker.md`
- ✅ Less manual PR creation work

---

## 🔄 New Workflow

```
1. Cheetah completes module
   ↓
2. Cheetah validates locally (Xcode build)
   ↓
3. You approve local validation
   ↓
4. Cheetah runs: ./automation/scripts/create-module-pr.sh <ModuleName>
   ↓
5. GitHub Actions creates PR automatically
   ↓
6. BugBot reviews (build, lint, security)
   ↓
7. BugBot posts report on PR
   ↓
8. If PASS → Auto-merge
   If FAIL → Create patch branch
   ↓
9. You check automation/logs/pr-tracker.md for status
   ↓
10. Cheetah waits for approval before next task
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Cheetah Must:
1. ✅ Run automation script after EVERY module
2. ✅ Use exact module name from task
3. ✅ Wait for BugBot approval before continuing
4. ✅ Check `automation/logs/pr-tracker.md` for status

### You Must:
1. ✅ Still do Xcode testing (automation doesn't replace this)
2. ✅ Review BugBot reports if issues found
3. ✅ Approve continuation after BugBot passes
4. ✅ Fix issues in patch branches if needed

---

## 📊 Example Flow

### Task 1.4: Update RewordingModule

```bash
# 1. Cheetah updates rewording.swift
# 2. Cheetah validates locally
# 3. You approve in Xcode

# 4. Cheetah runs automation:
./automation/scripts/create-module-pr.sh RewordingModule

# Output:
