## 🚀 Your Starting Point

### Step 1: Orientation (5 minutes)
Read `START_HERE.md` for context and workflow overview.

### Step 2: Begin Execution (40-52 hours)
Open `CHEETAH_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` and start with:
- **Stage 1, Task 1.1:** Create PromptSegment Type

### Step 3: Reference Legacy Code
For each task, read the specified lines from `xxx.txt`:
```
Example:
Task 1.1 → Read lines 1924-1979 for PromptSegment
Task 2.2 → Read lines 3722-4372 for PipelineManager
Task 3.2 → Read lines 9152-9273 for DeepSeekService
```

## 🎯 Critical Path (Priority Order)

### STAGE 1: FOUNDATION (12-16 hours) ⚠️ BLOCKING
```
1.1 Create PromptSegment ← ALL modules need this
1.2 Create PipelineContext ← ALL modules need this
1.3 Create MockAIService ← For testing
1.4 Update rewording.swift + 1.4b Build RewordingView ← Logic + UI
1.5 Update segmentation.swift + 1.5b Build SegmentationView ← Logic + UI
1.6 Update storyanalysis.swift + 1.6b Build StoryAnalysisView ← Logic + UI
1.7 Update taxonomy.swift + 1.7b Build TaxonomyView ← Logic + UI
1.8 Update continuity.swift + 1.8b Build ContinuityView ← Logic + UI
1.9 Validation Test ← Verify Stage 1
```

**NEW: Each module now has UI built immediately after logic!**

### STAGE 2: PIPELINE ORCHESTRATION (13-16 hours)
```
2.1 Create PipelineConfiguration
2.2 Create PipelineOrchestrator + 2.2b Build PipelineView ← Logic + UI
2.3-2.6 Add pipeline features
2.7 Integration Test
```

### STAGE 3: AI SERVICE (10-13 hours)
```
3.1 Create KeychainService ← Secure API keys
3.2 Create AIService + 3.2b Build AIServiceSettingsView ← Logic + UI
3.3 Add Rate Limiting
3.4-3.6 Update modules for real AI
```

### STAGE 4: PERSISTENCE (10-13 hours)
```
4.1 Create CoreData Model
4.2 Create PersistenceController + 4.2b Build ProjectsView ← Logic + UI
4.3-4.5 Integrate with Core
```

### STAGE 5: CREDITS (11-14 hours)
```
5.1 Create CreditsService
5.2 Create StoreKitService + 5.2b Build CreditsStoreView ← Logic + UI
5.3 Integrate with Pipeline
```

### STAGE 6: APP SHELL (10-12 hours)
```
6.1-6.6 Create app entry point and remaining UI
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

When you're done:
- [ ] All Swift files compile without errors
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline executes successfully
- [ ] Real AI API calls work
- [ ] Projects save/load from CoreData
- [ ] Credits system functional
- [ ] App has usable SwiftUI interface

---

## 🔧 Tools & Commands

### Compilation Check:
```bash
swiftc -parse core.swift rewording.swift segmentation.swift storyanalysis.swift taxonomy.swift continuity.swift
```

### Line Count:
```bash
wc -l *.swift
```

### Find in Legacy:
```bash
sed -n '1924,1979p' xxx.txt  # Read specific lines
grep -n "PromptSegment" xxx.txt  # Search for patterns
```

---

## 📋 Key Principles

### 1. Fidelity First
Every task has a **🎯 FIDELITY REMINDER**:
- Maintain 100% functionality from legacy code
- Preserve all properties, methods, and logic
- Keep all edge cases and error handling
- Don't simplify or skip features

### 2. Validate Always
Every module update has a **Validation** checklist:
- [ ] File compiles without errors
- [ ] Can instantiate module
- [ ] Can call validate()

### 3. Reference Legacy
Don't reinvent the wheel - the legacy code works. Copy patterns, adapt to modern architecture.

## 🚨 Known Issues & Gotchas

### Issue 1: PromptSegment is BLOCKING
- **Impact:** All 6 modules reference this type
- **Solution:** Task 1.1 creates it (lines 1924-1979 in xxx.txt)
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Do this first

### Issue 2: PipelineContext is BLOCKING
- **Impact:** All execute() methods need this
- **Solution:** Task 1.2 creates it (lines 4432-4456 in xxx.txt)
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Do this second

### Issue 3: Actor Isolation Warnings
- **Impact:** Some @MainActor warnings may appear
- **Solution:** Use `@MainActor` or `nonisolated` as needed
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Fix during validation

## 📞 Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the legacy code reference (xxx.txt)
2. Review RECONSTRUCTION_PLAN.md for technical details
3. Check ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md for visual diagrams
4. Refer to EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md for high-level context
