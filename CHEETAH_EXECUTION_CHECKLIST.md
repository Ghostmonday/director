## ü§ñ STAGE 3: AI SERVICE INTEGRATION

### Task 3.1: Create Secrets Configuration (Apple Best Practice)
**Files:** `Secrets.xcconfig`, `Secrets-template.xcconfig`, `.gitignore`, `Info.plist`
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH

**üéØ FIDELITY REMINDER:**
- Follow Apple security best practices
- Never commit API keys to git
- Use .xcconfig for build-time injection
- Provide template for developers

**Setup Steps:**

**1. Create Secrets-template.xcconfig (committed to git):**
```
// Secrets-template.xcconfig
// Copy this file to Secrets.xcconfig and add your actual API keys

// ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Use correct API key for each service
// DeepSeek: Text processing (rewording, story analysis, taxonomy, continuity)
// Pollo: Image generation ONLY

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY_HERE
POLLO_API_KEY = YOUR_POLLO_API_KEY_HERE
```

**2. Create Secrets.xcconfig (NOT committed, in .gitignore):**
```
// Secrets.xcconfig
// DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE

// DeepSeek API Key - For text processing modules
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = sk-your-actual-deepseek-api-key-here

// Pollo API Key - For image generation ONLY
POLLO_API_KEY = your-actual-pollo-api-key-here
```

**3. Update .gitignore:**
```
# API Keys and Secrets
Secrets.xcconfig
*.xcconfig
!Secrets-template.xcconfig
```

**4. Link .xcconfig to Xcode Project:**
- Open Project Settings
- Select Project (not target)
- Go to Info tab
- Under Configurations, set Secrets.xcconfig for Debug and Release

**5. Update Info.plist:**
```xml
<!-- Text Processing API (DeepSeek) -->
<key>DeepSeekAPIKey</key>
<string>$(DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)</string>

<!-- Image Generation API (Pollo) -->
<key>PolloAPIKey</key>
<string>$(POLLO_API_KEY)</string>
```

**6. Swift Access Pattern:**
```swift
// In AIService.swift (DeepSeek for text processing):
guard let apiKey = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "DeepSeekAPIKey") as? String,
      !apiKey.isEmpty,
      apiKey != "YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY_HERE" else {
    fatalError("DeepSeek API key not configured. See Secrets-template.xcconfig")
}

// In ImageGenerationService.swift (Pollo for images):
guard let apiKey = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "PolloAPIKey") as? String,
      !apiKey.isEmpty,
      apiKey != "YOUR_POLLO_API_KEY_HERE" else {
    fatalError("Pollo API key not configured. See Secrets-template.xcconfig")
}
```

**7. Create README Section:**
```markdown
## Developer Setup

### API Key Configuration

DirectorStudio requires TWO API keys:

1. **DeepSeek API Key** - For text processing:
   - Rewording module
   - Story analysis module
   - Taxonomy module
   - Continuity module
   - All text-based AI operations

2. **Pollo API Key** - For image generation ONLY:
   - Image generation module
   - Visual content creation

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Copy `Secrets-template.xcconfig` to `Secrets.xcconfig`
2. Edit `Secrets.xcconfig`:
   - Replace `YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY_HERE` with your DeepSeek API key
   - Replace `YOUR_POLLO_API_KEY_HERE` with your Pollo API key
3. Build and run

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix up these API keys. Each service has specific responsibilities.

**Note:** `Secrets.xcconfig` is gitignored and will never be committed.
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Secrets-template.xcconfig created with BOTH keys
- [ ] Secrets.xcconfig in .gitignore
- [ ] .xcconfig linked to Xcode project (Debug & Release)
- [ ] Info.plist reads $(DEEPSEEK_API_KEY) and $(POLLO_API_KEY)
- [ ] Swift can access both keys at runtime
- [ ] Keys NOT visible in git history
- [ ] Build fails gracefully if either key missing
- [ ] README documents BOTH keys and their specific uses
- [ ] Clear warning about NOT mixing up the keys

    // - HTTP request handling to DeepSeek API
    // - Authentication (Bearer token with deepSeekAPIKey)
    // - Response parsing
    // - Error handling
}
```

**Validation:**

### Task 7.5: Add Accessibility Validation
**File:** Accessibility audit across all views
**Priority:** üü° HIGH

**üéØ FIDELITY REMINDER:**
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Support VoiceOver completely
- Ensure Dynamic Type support
- Test with accessibility tools

**Implementation:**
```swift
// For every view, ensure:

// 1. VoiceOver Support
// - All interactive elements have accessibility labels
// - Proper accessibility hints
// - Logical focus order
// - Grouped related elements

// Example:
Button(action: generateVideo) {
    Image(systemName: "play.circle")
}
.accessibilityLabel("Generate Video")
.accessibilityHint("Starts video generation from your prompt")

// 2. Dynamic Type
// - Use .font(.body), .font(.headline), etc.
// - Avoid fixed font sizes
// - Test with largest accessibility sizes

// 3. Color Contrast
// - Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
// - Don't rely on color alone
// - Support both light and dark mode

// 4. Reduce Motion
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion

if reduceMotion {
    // Use simple transitions
} else {
    // Use animated transitions
}

// 5. Create AccessibilityAuditService
public actor AccessibilityAuditService {
    func auditView(_ view: String) -> AccessibilityReport
    func generateReport() -> ComprehensiveAccessibilityReport
}
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] VoiceOver works on all screens
- [ ] Dynamic Type supported
