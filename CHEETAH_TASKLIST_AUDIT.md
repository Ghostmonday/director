# 🔍 Cheetah Task List Audit Report

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** Audit Complete - Issues Found  
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH - Requires Immediate Fixes

---

## 📊 Summary

**Total Tasks:** 56 tasks across 8 stages  
**Issues Found:** 8 critical issues affecting workflow efficiency  
**Impact:** Medium-High (could cause confusion and workflow delays)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **Task Numbering Inconsistency** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Issue:** Task numbering is out of logical order
**Location:** Stage 6 vs Stage 7

**Problem:**
```
Stage 7: Task 7.1: Create App Entry Point
         Task 6.2-6.6: Create UI Views  ← WRONG NUMBERING
```

**Impact:** Cheetah may execute tasks out of logical sequence

**Fix Required:**
- Rename Task 6.2-6.6 to Task 7.2
- Reorder UI tasks to follow proper stage sequence

---

### 2. **Broken Logical Flow** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Issue:** Tasks from different stages are intermixed
**Location:** Tasks 6.2-6.6 appear in Stage 7

**Current Structure:**
```
Stage 6: Video Pipeline (Tasks 6.1-6.9)
Stage 7: App Shell & UI (Task 7.1, then 6.2-6.6)
```

**Should Be:**
```
Stage 6: Video Pipeline (Tasks 6.1-6.9)
Stage 7: App Shell & UI (Tasks 7.1-7.5)
```

---

### 3. **Critical Path Mismatch** 🟡 HIGH
**Issue:** Critical path references incorrect task names
**Location:** Bottom of checklist

**Problem:**
```
Critical Path says: "Create KeychainService (Task 3.1)"
Actual Task 3.1: "Create Secrets Configuration (Apple Best Practice)"
```

**Missing from Critical Path:**
- Task 3.2a: ImageGenerationService (marked 🔴 HIGH priority)

---

### 4. **UI Task Scattered Organization** 🟠 MEDIUM
**Issue:** UI tasks are spread across stages instead of grouped logically

**Current Distribution:**
- Stage 1: 4 UI tasks (1.4b, 1.5b, 1.6b, 1.7b, 1.8b)
- Stage 2: 1 UI task (2.2b)
- Stage 3: 1 UI task (3.2b)
- Stage 4: 1 UI task (4.2b)
- Stage 5: 1 UI task (5.2b)
- Stage 6: 5 UI tasks (6.2b, 6.3b, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7)
- Stage 7: Mixed with Stage 6 tasks

**Recommendation:** Group all UI tasks in Stage 7 for better workflow

---

### 5. **Module Name Inconsistency** 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Some tasks have "Module Name" field, others don't
**Location:** Inconsistent across tasks

**Problem:**
- Tasks 1.1-1.8b have "Module Name:" field
- Tasks 2.1+ don't have this field

**Impact:** Minor - affects consistency but not functionality

---

### 6. **Missing Task Dependencies** 🟠 MEDIUM
**Issue:** Some tasks reference other tasks that come later in the list
**Location:** Various tasks

**Example:**
- Task 1.9 references "all modules" but some UI tasks come after it
- Video generation tasks (Stage 6) may depend on earlier AI setup (Stage 3)

---

### 7. **Automation Integration Missing** 🟡 HIGH
**Issue:** Some tasks don't mention the AUTO-PR requirement
**Location:** Tasks without AUTO-PR triggers

**Problem:**
- Not all tasks include the automation workflow
- Inconsistent automation integration

**Impact:** Some modules won't get automated PR review

---

### 8. **Success Metrics Incomplete** 🟢 LOW
**Issue:** Success metrics don't reflect all completed work
**Location:** Bottom of checklist

**Missing from Success Metrics:**
- Video generation functionality
- UI accessibility
- Security audit completion
- Telemetry systems
- Developer dashboard

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Immediate Fixes (🔴 CRITICAL):

1. **Fix Task Numbering:**
   ```diff
   - ### Task 6.2-6.6: Create UI Views
   + ### Task 7.2: Create Additional UI Views
   ```

2. **Reorder Stage 7:**
   - Move Task 7.1 first
   - Group all UI tasks in Stage 7
   - Remove intermingled Stage 6 tasks

3. **Update Critical Path:**
   ```diff
   - 8. Create KeychainService (Task 3.1)
   + 8. Create Secrets Configuration (Task 3.1)
   + 9. Create ImageGenerationService (Task 3.2a)
   ```

### Medium Fixes (🟡 HIGH):

4. **Add Missing AUTO-PR Triggers:**
   - Ensure ALL module tasks include automation workflow
   - Add to any missing tasks

5. **Fix Dependencies:**
   - Review task order for logical dependencies
   - Ensure prerequisites come before dependent tasks

### Minor Fixes (🟢 LOW):

6. **Add Module Names Consistently:**
   - Add "Module Name:" field to all tasks

7. **Update Success Metrics:**
   ```diff
   + - [ ] Video generation works
   + - [ ] Accessibility compliant
   + - [ ] Security audit passed
   + - [ ] Telemetry functional
   ```
