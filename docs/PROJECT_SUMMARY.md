# DirectorStudio Project Summary

## Overview

DirectorStudio is an AI-powered video generation platform that transforms text stories into cinematic videos. It provides a comprehensive pipeline for story analysis, segmentation, video generation, and post-processing.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **DirectorStudioCore**: Central orchestration system
- **PersistenceManager**: Data persistence and management
- **MonetizationManager**: Credits and purchases management
- **GUIAbstraction**: Interface layer for future SwiftUI integration

### Processing Modules

- **SegmentationModule**: Breaking down stories into filmable segments
- **RewordingModule**: Text style transformation
- **StoryAnalysisModule**: Deep analysis of text content
- **TaxonomyModule**: Cinematic taxonomy enrichment
- **ContinuityModule**: Continuity validation
- **VideoGenerationModule**: AI-powered video creation
- **VideoAssemblyModule**: Video assembly pipeline
- **VideoEffectsModule**: Post-processing effects

### Interfaces

- **DirectorStudioCLI**: Command-line interface
- **GUIAbstraction**: Interface for future GUI implementation
