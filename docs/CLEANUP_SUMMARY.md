# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview

The DirectorStudio repository has been thoroughly cleaned and organized to improve maintainability, readability, and development efficiency.

## Cleanup Actions

### Directory Structure

- **Created organized directory structure:**
  - `/docs`: All documentation files
  - `/logs`: Log files and execution reports
  - `/scripts`: Utility and build scripts
    - `/scripts/build`: Build-related scripts
    - `/scripts/utils`: Utility scripts

### File Cleanup

- **Removed temporary files:**
  - Object files (*.o)
  - Build artifacts
  - Swap and backup files
  - .DS_Store files

### Documentation

- **Organized documentation:**
  - Moved all .md files to `/docs` directory
  - Created new documentation:
    - `README.md`: Project overview
    - `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: Detailed project summary
    - `GETTING_STARTED.md`: Getting started guide

### Scripts

- **Created utility scripts:**
  - `scripts/build/build.sh`: Build script with clean, build, and test options
  - `scripts/utils/run-cli.sh`: CLI runner script

### Configuration

- **Added configuration files:**
  - `.gitignore`: Prevents committing temporary files and build artifacts

## File Organization

### Root Directory

The root directory now contains only essential files:
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `Package.swift`: Swift Package Manager configuration
- `Package.resolved`: Resolved dependencies
- `Secrets-template.xcconfig`: Template for secrets configuration
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore configuration

### Documentation

All documentation is now organized in the `/docs` directory, making it easier to find and reference.

### Scripts

All scripts are now organized in the `/scripts` directory, with subdirectories for specific purposes.

## Benefits

- **Improved navigation:** Easier to find files and understand project structure
- **Better maintainability:** Cleaner repository with organized files
- **Reduced clutter:** Removed temporary and unnecessary files
- **Better onboarding:** Clear documentation and getting started guide
- **Streamlined development:** Utility scripts for common tasks

## Next Steps

1. **Maintain organization:** Continue to follow the established directory structure
2. **Update documentation:** Keep documentation up to date as the project evolves
3. **Enhance scripts:** Add more utility scripts as needed
4. **Improve build process:** Further optimize the build process
