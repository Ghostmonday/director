## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview

The restored DirectorStudio follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Core Layer:** `DirectorStudioCore` provides central orchestration
2. **Module Layer:** Individual modules for specific functionality
3. **Service Layer:** Shared services like AI and persistence
4. **Interface Layer:** CLI and GUI abstraction for user interaction

### Key Files

- **`DirectorStudioCore.swift`:** Central orchestration system
- **`VideoGenerationModule.swift`:** AI-powered video generation
- **`VideoAssemblyModule.swift`:** Video assembly pipeline
- **`VideoEffectsModule.swift`:** Post-processing effects
- **`PersistenceManager.swift`:** Data persistence system
- **`MonetizationManager.swift`:** Credits and purchases
- **`GUIAbstraction.swift`:** Interface for future SwiftUI integration
- **`main.swift`:** CLI entry point

### Error Handling Strategy

The system uses a comprehensive error handling approach:

1. **Module-Level Errors:** Specific error types for each module
2. **Core-Level Errors:** Unified error reporting and handling
3. **Timeout Protection:** Automatic cancellation of long-running tasks
4. **Fallback Mechanisms:** Graceful degradation when services fail

### Data Flow

1. **Input:** Text story or project data
2. **Processing:** Pipeline of modules for segmentation, analysis, etc.
3. **Generation:** Video creation based on processed data
4. **Output:** Video files or JSON data
5. **Persistence:** Storage of projects and segments
